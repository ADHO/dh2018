      <a class="link_ref" href="https://tinyurl.com/DH2017-AdvancingLOD">
        <span style="text-decoration:underline;color:1155CC">LOD workshop in Montreal</span>
      </a> that saw 30 plus people come together and discuss the potential for linked data in the humanities, we propose a workshop that focuses more specifically on interacting with Linked Data. There are many different platforms for working with linked data 
      <span style="color:222222">—</span> for visualizing, creating, reconciling, cleaning, and analyzing it. Some of these tools have been developed from within the Digital Humanities community, and others have been developed beyond it but adapted to our purposes. We hope to create the opportunity for fruitful exchange by providing time for hands-on demonstration and discussion.
    </p>
    <p>All participants will have the opportunity to submit the following in advance of the workshop:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="item">Answering an online form that indicates the type of LOD tools or platforms, or features within these, that they wish to see discussed at the workshop.</li>
      <li class="item">Details on where their tool (if they have one) fits in, and a description of their work with LOD.</li>
      <li class="item">A description (1 page max) of their LOD platform with features that they wish to showcase during the workshop.</li>
