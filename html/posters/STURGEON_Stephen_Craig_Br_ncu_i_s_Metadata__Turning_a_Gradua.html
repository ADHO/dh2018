    <p>This poster outlines the planning stages for introducing a substantial digital assignment to a paper-based graduate Humanities course and describes techniques for making metadata interesting to graduate students who have never had occasion to give much thought to it. It also details the experience of a librarian co-teaching a graduate seminar, and may provide a basis for reflection on where the particular types of bridges that get built in these activities lead: are they bridges that well-prepared students will take into a competitive job market? Bridges that subject librarians and faculty members will use to traverse a new collaborative environment? Bridges that students will send their scholarly ideas and projects across to a web-based public? Or bridges for university administrators to point to for the comparison of their respective bridges?</p>
